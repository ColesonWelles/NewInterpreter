# NewInterpreter

Restarting my efforts to work through Thorsten Ball's "Writing An Interpreter In Go" with plans to;

1) To procede on with Ball's "Writing A Compiler In Go".

2) Take up Ball's challenge for his readers to refactor the interpreter to accept Unicode instead of just ASCII
characters.
